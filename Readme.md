This script was adapted from my other installjava script.  This script should be run from the same folder as your downloaded Oracle java jdk*.tar.gz file, and it will then unpack the tar file and install java on a Manjaro or Arch system.  The difference between this script and my other python script that does the same thing is that I have adapted this script to use tkinter messageboxes in the GUI.  I am a total beginner with Python and so am doing this project to learn a bit about it.  If you have any advice or tips for me it would be appreciated.
